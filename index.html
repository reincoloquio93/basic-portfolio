            <p class="paragraph1"> Hi, my name is Rein Coloquio. I live in Jersey City, New Jersey. I am currently
                enrolled
                in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and slowly learning about HTML and CSS. Prior to pursuing this career, I work
                as
                a part time Ride-share driver and personal trainer. I didn’t want to continue on this path due to stress
                and
                fluctuation of my income. I didn’t see much room for growth and I did not have a rewarding feeling
                everyday
                for what I was doing. I had always enjoyed technology and computers but never knew any more than the
                average
                user. I want to become a web developer because I feel like I could make a living wage, in demand, create
                amazing work that people use everyday, and further challenge my intellectual.
